As pointed out by Prof. Dr. Klaus-Dieter Liss from Technion - Israel
Institute of Technology in his 2018-12-07 07:39 report, the cell
constants in this entry were actually recorded in kX units, not in \%A
units as the CIF standard mandates. To make data uniform and to match
the definition of the CIF _cell_length_* data items, all cell
constants were multiplied by the 1.00202 coefficient (taken from Wood,
E. A.  The Conversion Factor for kX Units to Angstr\"om Units Journal
of Applied Physics, AIP Publishing, 1947, 18, 929 DOI:
10.1063/1.1697570, https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1697570).

In addition, in the original entry the _cell_length_c was apparently
taken from the wrong row in the published table. This value was
corrected as well.

 Added the _cell_formula_units_Z data item.
