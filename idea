Your idea of using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn representations of crystal structures, then using an autoencoder to extract the most important features, is a very interesting approach. This is a form of unsupervised learning, where the goal is to learn a useful representation of the data without any specific prediction task in mind.

Here's a high-level overview of how this could work:

Graph Neural Network (GNN): You would start by representing each crystal structure as a graph, where the nodes represent atoms and the edges represent bonds. You could then train a GNN on these graphs. The GNN would learn to encode each graph into a fixed-size vector that captures the important features of the crystal structure.

Autoencoder: You would then feed these vectors into an autoencoder. The autoencoder would learn to compress these vectors into a smaller number of dimensions (the "latent space"), and then reconstruct the original vectors from this compressed representation. The goal of this step is to learn a lower-dimensional representation of the data that captures the most important features.

Prediction: Finally, you could use these lower-dimensional representations as input to a prediction model. This could be another neural network, or any other type of machine learning model. The model would be trained to predict some property of the crystal structure, such as its stability or its space group.

This approach could potentially be very powerful, as it would allow you to learn a compact representation of the crystal structures that captures the most important features for prediction. However, it would also be quite complex and computationally intensive, and it would require a large dataset of known crystal structures to train on.

It's also worth noting that this is a very active area of research, and there are many different ways to approach the problem. For example, instead of using a separate GNN and autoencoder, you could use a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE), which combines the two steps into a single model. Or you could use a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) or a Graph Attention Network (GAT), which are other types of GNNs that have been used for similar tasks.
